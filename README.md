# Markdown Viewer This project provides a simple, single-file HTML application that renders Markdown content (`input.md`) directly in the browser. It leverages `Marked.js` for Markdown parsing and `Tailwind CSS` for a modern, responsive design. ## Features - **Markdown to HTML Conversion:** Automatically converts the `input.md` file into styled HTML. - **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS to look great on any device. - **Single-File Application:** All necessary code (HTML, CSS, JS) is contained within `index.html` for easy deployment and sharing. - **Local File Support:** Designed to work by loading `input.md` from the same directory. ## Getting Started To view the Markdown content, simply follow these steps: 1. **Save the files:** Ensure `index.html` and `input.md` are saved in the same directory. 2. **Open `index.html`:** Double-click `index.html` in your file explorer, or open it with your web browser. The `input.md` content will be rendered and displayed on the page. ## Project Structure - `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the application logic, styling, and content rendering. - `input.md`: The Markdown file whose content will be converted and displayed. (Provided as an attachment) ## Technologies Used - **Marked.js:** A markdown parser and compiler. Built for speed. - **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. ## License This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
